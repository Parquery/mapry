Installation
============

We provide a prepackaged PEX file that can be readily downloaded and executed.
Please see the `Releases section <https://github.com/Parquery/mapry/releases>`_.

If you prefer to use Mapry as a library (*e.g.*, as part of your Python-based
build system), install it with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install mapry
