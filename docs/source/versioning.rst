Versioning
==========

We follow `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0.html>`_.
We extended the standard semantic versioning with an additional format version.
The version W.X.Y.Z indicates:

* W is the format version (data representation is backward-incompatible),
* X is the major version (library interface is backward-incompatible),
* Y is the minor version (library interface is extended, but
  backward-compatible), and
* Z is the patch version (backward-compatible bug fix).
